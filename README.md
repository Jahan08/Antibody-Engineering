## The objectives of this learning:
1. Understand and demonstrate the importance of proper protein preparation and reliabilityanalysis
2. Recall basic sequence analysis workflows in the Multiple Sequence Viewer/Editor
3. Recall and apply knowledge of protein surface analysis
4. Recall and apply knowledge of antibody structure prediction and humanization
5. Recall and apply knowledge of protein-protein docking by setting up an antibody-antigendocking job and analyzing the results
6. Recall and apply knowledge of residue scanning by running an alanine scanning job andanalyzing the results
7. Complete a case study covering a particular antibody engineering; 
8. Evaluate antibody-antigenbinding, justify mutation selection and compute MM-GBSA binding energy predictions for the proposed mutants
