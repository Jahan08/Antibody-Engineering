## Antibodies
Antibodies, also known as Immunoglobulins (Ig) are gamma globulin proteins, primarily found in the blood of vertebrates. These glycoproteins serve as a critical component of the immune system when the host fails to activate alternative compliment pathways or phagocytic cells in response to invading microorganisms or other antigens. The incredible specificity with which immunoglobulins bind to an antigen is based upon structural complementarity between the antigen and antibody heavy and light chains.

When a foreign antigen binds to a B-lymphocyte (B-cell), it activates the B-cell, and upon stimulation by helper T-cells, undergoes clonal proliferation and B-cell maturation into antibody forming plasma cells. Each plasma cell is programmed to make an antibody of a single specificity, which it releases into the blood.

#### Structure
The basic functional unit of an antibody is an immunoglobulin monomer, but antibodies secreted from plasma cells are typically dimeric with occasional higher order structures. Typical secreted antibodies have a basic four-peptide structure of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains joined together by interchain disulfide bonds, forming a “Y” shaped molecule.

The disulfide bonds are positioned within a flexible region called the hinge region, which seperates the lobes of the antibody from one another and provides ample flexibility to bind antigens effectively. [1] Each domain (2 heavy and 2 light) contain between 70-110 amino acids and are classified into different categories according to size and function. [4] Both domains, heavy and light, contain variable and constant regions that are crucial to antibody function.

#### Heavy Chain
There are five types of immunoglobulin heavy chains, in mammals, α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, and give rise to the five unique classes or isotypes of antibodies, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, which differ in size and composition. Each heavy chain has a constant region and variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differ in antibodies of different isotypes; i.e. all IgA have the same sequence in their heavy chain constant region, but these constant regions differ between IgA and IgD, etc. [6] The α, δ, and γ heavy chains have a constant region composed of three tandem immunoglobulin domains while heavy chains ε and μ contain four. The variable region of the heavy chain in antibodies is different for all antibodies created by different B-cells.
